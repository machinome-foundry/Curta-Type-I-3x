"""The source stop pin compresses its documented .6 mm wire spring.

Manual page 40 specifies a .6 × 5 × 20 mm spring. Native sections give eight
turns at R 2.55, with 21 mm free centerline height. The sleeve and pin shoulder
set the installed length; this is a contact-driven shape, not a force model.
